This directory contains some code showing the basic usage of google leveldb.
The functions of the files are listed as follows:

createdb.cc: how to create a databse file with leveldb.
write_read.cc: how to write and read (key, value) pair to/from leveldb.
comparator.cc: how to use customized comparator.
batch_write.cc: how to use batched write operations.

Besides, a file keygen.cc is provided to generate sequential keys for testing.

To compile the source files, the leveldb include files and libleveldb.a should 
be copied to the current directory. Please use Makefile to compile them.
