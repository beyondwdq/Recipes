Why I wrote TinyConfig
----------------------

Almost every program needs a configuration function to define the system
parameters and read them from file, sometimes also from command-line. During
my development of a simulator, I wanted a simply and easy-to-use configuration
parser without dependencies on non-standard C++ libraries. Hence I began to work 
on it and finally I got TinyConfig. 

Previously I was considering separating the Reader (which reads and parses file)
from the Parameters (which defines the parameters). With this separation, it is 
possible to support more format in the future by deriving new Readers. However, 
I decided to keep it simple, so all codes are packed into one class "Config". 
And this is it. It is simple. It is clear. And It works.

TinyConfig has the following functions:

1) It reads parameters from a simple file format. Each line defines a parameter 
with the format of "key = value", where "key" is the name of the parameter 
and "value" specifies the assigned value. No hierarchy is supported.

2) With every defined parameter, invoke Config::add() to register it to the 
parser. Then the Config will automatically set the value if it is specified in 
the configuration file.

3) Three types of parameters are supported: bool, int and double.

In the current test defined in test/config_test.cc, a sub-class is derived from
class Config to define parameters. However, I really prefer to just copy the 
Config class, add parameters to it and invoke Config::add() in its constructor.
