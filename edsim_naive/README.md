The `edsim_naive` project implements a simple event-driven simulator. 

**NOTE:** `edsim_naive` is naively simple, both in terms of efficiency and
design. This is intentionally made by the author to clearly illustrate how a
event-driven simulator works without sophisticated language and algorithm
details involved.
