This directory containes some utilities I have written during my developement.

* fixedsizeorderedlist.h implements an ordered list with fixed size. 
The class `FixedSizeOrderedList` is derived from `std::set`. It works, 
but some future work is needed, i.e. some of the methods of `set` should not be 
exposed to users.

* helper.h includes a set of utility functions for various purposes. All functions 
are in the namespace `mtl`.
